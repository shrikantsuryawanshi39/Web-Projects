# Spotify Clone Project

This project is a front-end clone of Spotify that emulates some of the key features of the popular music streaming platform. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a seamless user experience across different devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The project is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: The application fetches song data dynamically, allowing for an interactive music browsing experience.
- **Music Player**: Includes a functional music player with controls for play, pause, and skip.
- **Volume Control**: The volume control is visible on larger screens (PC) and automatically hides on smaller screens (mobile devices) for a cleaner interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application, including custom animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic content loading, event handling, and interactive UI components.
